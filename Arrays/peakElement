A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        return iterative(nums);
    }
    
    public int iterative(int[] nums){
        
        for(int i = 0; i< nums.length-1; i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i+1]){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return nums.length-1;
    }
}
