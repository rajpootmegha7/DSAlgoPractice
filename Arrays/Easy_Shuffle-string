You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.
Example 1 : 
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        //Exit condition if the indices and string is same then return the same string.
        if(s == indices.toString()) return s;
        
        char[] out = new char[indices.length];
        
        //Main logic 
    
        for(int i = 0; i < indices.length; i++){
            out[indices[i]] = s.charAt(i);
        }
        return new String(out);
    }
}
